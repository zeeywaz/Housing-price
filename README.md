# Housing Price Prediction 🏠📈

A regression-based machine learning model that predicts housing prices using the **Random Forest Regressor**. Trained on an open-source housing dataset, this model captures complex relationships between various features like area, number of rooms, location, and more to generate accurate price estimations.
